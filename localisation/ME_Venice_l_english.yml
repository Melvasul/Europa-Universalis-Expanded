It required all ships returning to Venice to load their ballast with salt. Following this, the Magistrato al Sal was established to handle the customs of salt imports. It did not take long for 'White Gold' to become an important sector of the Venetian economy, as the Republic expanded her overseas territories specifically to capture salt producing locations, as well as constructing her own. All this salt of course had to stored somewhere. Special warehouses known as 'Saloni' were constructed in Dorsoduro, in the district now known as Punta della Dogana.
