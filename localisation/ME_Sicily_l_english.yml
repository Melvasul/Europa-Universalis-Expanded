The peace of Caltabellotta, in 1302, sanctioned the end of the war and gave the aforementioned separation (according to the agreements, on the death of the Aragonese king Frederick of Aragon, the island should have returned to the Angevins, which in reality did not happen). \nAnd still we are awaiting, for the time now is right to rivendicate our claims on the crown of Aragon and crushing it completely."

 sic_blooming_art_title: "Blooming Art"
 sic_blooming_art_desc: "The beginning of the fifteenth century is characterized in Sicily by the Franco-Provençal and Pisan-Sienese influence on artistic figurative culture which finds its maximum expression in the fresco of the masterpiece of the Triumph of late Gothic death. The greatest artists of the period are Gaspare da Pesaro and his son Guglielmo Pesaro. \nIn architecture, the intense construction activity is characterized by its adherence to late Gothic forms with the Iberian mark (especially in the Val di Noto), and by the persistence of decorations and planimetric motifs that have been repeated since the Norman era. \nPalermo and Messina, among the main cities, went through a phase of demographic and economic growth in the fifteenth century thanks to the presence of the port and numerous communities of Pisan, Venetian, Lombard and Genoese merchants. Even the social structure of the city was renewed with a class of officials and merchants who joined the nobility by building noble palaces and chapels and requesting refined artifacts of great value. \nThese premises, thanks to the arrival of numerous artists of the peninsula and the influence of the Neapolitan artistic environment of the Alfonso II period, allowed the renewal of the artistic language in Sicily."
 sic_parramentu_sicilianu_title: "Parramentu Sicilianu"
 sic_parramentu_sicilianu_desc: "May God bless and inspire Parliament's vows addressed to this holy end; may he regard the land of Sicily benignly and join it to the great destinies of the Italian nation, free, independent and united. \nThe Sicilian parliament is considered one of the oldest in the world, together with that of the Isle of Man, Icelandic and Faroese which however had no deliberative powers, a circumstance that makes the Sicilian Parliament the first in a modern sense: in 1097 there was the first assize to Mazara del Vallo convened by the Grand Conte Ruggero I of Sicily, of an initially itinerant parliament. \nBut it was in 1130 with the convening of the Curiae generales by Roger II in Palermo, in the Palazzo dei Normanni for the proclamation of the King of Sicily that we can speak of the first parliament in the modern sense. The first king of Sicily in fact received royal dignity from the sanction of Parliament, and the event imposed the canon - albeit unencoded - for which all subsequent rulers of the Kingdom of Sicily alternating on the throne were to obtain assent (more than approval) of Parliament."
 sic_mountains_aspromonte_title: "Mountains of Aspromonte"
 sic_mountains_aspromonte_desc: "Under the dominion of the Angevins and then of the Aragonese, the Duchy of Calabria inherited the previous subdivision in the two provinces, Ultra Nethum and Citra Nethum. In both provinces, feudal lands and cities (among them Catanzaro, Crotone, Squillace) and state lands were distinguished. \nIn 1307 Charles II of Anjou granted his son Roberto the title of Duke of Calabria and since the title was usually assumed by all heirs to the throne. \nState-owned cities were Reggio, Cosenza and Castrovillari, including their farmhouses: in them the king was represented by a "captain of the fortress" and mayors and magistrates were elected. \nAfter suppressing the last pockets of Swabian resistance, the Angevin dynasty established an oppressive and vexatious government in Calabria, based on the extension of the feudal latifundium and harassing the population with an exorbitant fiscal policy. In 1442, when Alfonso V of Aragon conquered the Angevin continental territories, he also started a reorganization of Calabria, removing the rank of capital in Reggio Calabria, which had supported his rival to the throne, assigning it to Catanzaro."
 sic_campania_title: "La Campania"
 sic_campania_desc: "The Duchy of Naples was involved, since its birth and throughout its existence, in a continuous and almost uninterrupted sequence of wars, mainly defensive, against the pressure of its powerful and numerous neighbors. Among these, mainly, the Lombard principalities of Benevento, Salerno and Capua, the Saracen corsairs, the Byzantine emperors, the popes and, finally, the Normans, who conquered it definitively in 1137, putting an end to its history. \nThe kingdom, as sovereign state, saw a great intellectual, economic and civil flourishing both under the various Angevin dynasties (1282-1442), both with the Aragonese reconquest of Alfonso I (1442-), and under the government of a cadet branch of the house of Aragon; then the capital Naples was famous for the splendor of its court and the patronage of sovereigns."
 sic_city_500_domes_title: "City of 500 Domes"
 sic_city_500_domes_desc: "Following the revolt that broke out in Sicily in 1282 (Sicilian Vespers, also caused by the official movement of the capital from Palermo to Naples) and the passage of the island to Aragonese domination, Naples, became the capital of the Kingdom of Naples, to this period stays in the city of Francesco Petrarca, Simone Martini, Giotto (who will found one of the most important Giotto pictorial schools in Italy) and Boccaccio. \nThe ruler Alfonso the Magnanimous privileged the city, making it the capital of his Mediterranean Empire, Alfonso's reign was characterized by the expansion of the perimeter of the city and the construction of a mighty wall with twenty-two cylindrical towers. In this period important city monuments were also built, such as the Arco del Maschio Angioino. \nEven the cultural climate experienced a considerable increase, thanks to the great impulse given by Alfonso to the city library and the foundation of the Pontaniana Academy. The large sums spent in promoting culture gave impetus to a flourishing of activities, which made Naples the protagonist of humanism and the Renaissance. \n\n\"The thing that seemed most extraordinary to us in Naples is the number and magnificence of its churches; I can tell you without exaggerating that this goes beyond the imaginable, at least 500\""

 ME_Sicily_Events.1.D: "Se mala segnoria, che sempre accora (If bad lordship, which always torments)\nli popoli suggetti, non avesse(subject peoples, had not)\nmosso Palermo a gridar: \"Mora, mora!\" (moved Palermo to shout: \"Die , die!\")\n\nEverything began in conjunction with the serial function of the Vespers of the $ DATE $, Monday of the Angel, in the churchyard of the church of the Holy Spirit, in Palermo. \nTo generate the episode was the reaction to the gesture of a soldier of the Aragonese army, such Drouet, who had turned disrespectfully to a young noblewoman accompanied by his wife, putting his hands on her on the pretext of having to search her. \nIn defense of his wife, the groom managed to steal the sword from the soldier and kill him. This gesture constituted the spark that started the revolt. \nIn the course of the evening and the night that followed the people of Palermo - with the cry of "Mora, mora!" - they indulged in a real "hunt for the Aragonese" which quickly spread throughout the island, becoming a carnage. The few Aragonese who survived the massacre succeeded in taking refuge in their ships, moored along the coast. \nTo locate the French who disguised themselves as commoners, we resorted to a shibboleth, showing them chickpeas ("cíciri", in our language) and asking to pronounce their name; those who were betrayed by their Aragonese pronunciation (cigrons), were immediately killed.\n\nOur diplomats will take at least 60 days before being able to report back."

 ME_Sicily_Events.7.T: "Sicilian Renaissance"
 ME_Sicily_Events.7.D: "The gigantic figure in the cultural landscape of the early Renaissance in Sicily is Antonello da Messina who with his complex formation between Naples, Venice and Flanders demonstrates the circulation of ideas that characterized the era. His works for the commissions of the island and his definitive return home represented the first affirmation of Renaissance painting on the island, thanks to a crowded laboratory that introduced the new taste for the human figure, the pictorial genre of the portrait into traditional production. and a new role of the artist are no longer just an anonymous craftsman. \nAmong the most interesting artists active in Messina Giorgio da Milano, Andrea Mancino, Bernardino Nobile and the Carrarese Giovan Battista Mazzolo, owner of an important workshop, which was joined by Messina Antonio Freri (also active in Catania), without count the presence of Antonello Gagini, son of Domenico, in Messina. As in Palermo, these Tuscan and Lombard artists brought in the city and its surroundings to Calabria, the rich repertoire of classicist architectural decorations. However, throughout the fifteenth century, despite some obsolete interpretations, the architecture continued to follow the late Gothic tradition despite the presence of Renaissance decorative episodes. \nThe renewal of language therefore did not immediately involve the entire building organization. The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers. In addition to the few traces left by Laurana, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Renaissance language can be found only in minor episodes such as the Ventimiglia chapel in the church of San Francesco in Castelbuono."

 ME_Sicily_Events.8.T: "Civitas Invitissima"
 ME_Sicily_Events.8.D: "The city of Drepanum has a long story of being the shield of the Island against foreign armies, The important strategic position was used during the First Punic War when the Carthaginians defeated the Roman fleet in the Battle of Trapani in 249 BC. Thus the Romans conquered the city, latinizing its name in Drepanum. \n\nAfter the Romans, the Vandals, then the Byzantines dominated the city, but it was in the 9th century AD. with the Arabs (who called it Itràbinis, Taràbanis, Tràpanesch) and with the Normans (who conquered it in 1077 led by Roger I) that the city reached a fervent development, thriving in trade and cultural activities, so the port had great turmoil also thanks to the crusades. The port of Trapani, during the Middle Ages, was one of the most important in the Mediterranean: all the most powerful seaside cities (Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Amalfi) had a consulate in the Trapani port and, especially with the first two, Trapani had the agreement to act as a stopover for their possessions in North Africa. \n\nIn 1266 the Venetian and Genoese fleets collided in front of the port of Trapani during the San Saba war. The Venetians captured the entire Genoese fleet. \n\nAfter a short period under the Angevins, Trapani actively participated in the uprising of the Sicilian Vespers led by Palmiero Abate, passing to the Aragonese in 1282. During the 14th and 15th centuries the city grew and became the most economically and politically important center of western Sicily. In 1443, from simple Earth it became Civitas. Ferdinand the Catholic granted the city the title of Invittissima in this regard \"of the glorious resistance always made to the enemies of the kingdom\"."
