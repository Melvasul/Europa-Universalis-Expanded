 sic_blooming_art_title: "Blooming Art"
 sic_blooming_art_desc: "The beginning of the fifteenth century is characterized in Sicily by the Franco-Provençal and Pisan-Sienese influence on artistic figurative culture which finds its maximum expression in the fresco of the masterpiece of the Triumph of late Gothic death. The greatest artists of the period are Gaspare da Pesaro and his son Guglielmo Pesaro. \nIn architecture, the intense construction activity is characterized by its adherence to late Gothic forms with the Iberian mark (especially in the Val di Noto), and by the persistence of decorations and planimetric motifs that have been repeated since the Norman era. \nPalermo and Messina, among the main cities, went through a phase of demographic and economic growth in the fifteenth century thanks to the presence of the port and numerous communities of Pisan, Venetian, Lombard and Genoese merchants. Even the social structure of the city was renewed with a class of officials and merchants who joined the nobility by building noble palaces and chapels and requesting refined artifacts of great value. \nThese premises, thanks to the arrival of numerous artists of the peninsula and the influence of the Neapolitan artistic environment of the Alfonso II period, allowed the renewal of the artistic language in Sicily."

 ME_Sicily_Events.1.T: "Vespri Siciliani"
 ME_Sicily_Events.1.D: "Se mala segnoria, che sempre accora (If bad lordship, which always torments)\nli popoli suggetti, non avesse(subject peoples, had not)\nmosso Palermo a gridar: \"Mora, mora!\" (moved Palermo to shout: \"Die , die!\")\n\nEverything began in conjunction with the serial function of the Vespers of the $ DATE $, Monday of the Angel, in the churchyard of the church of the Holy Spirit, in Palermo. \nTo generate the episode was the reaction to the gesture of a soldier of the Aragonese army, such Drouet, who had turned disrespectfully to a young noblewoman accompanied by his wife, putting his hands on her on the pretext of having to search her. \nIn defense of his wife, the groom managed to steal the sword from the soldier and kill him. This gesture constituted the spark that started the revolt. \nIn the course of the evening and the night that followed the people of Palermo - with the cry of "Mora, mora!" - they indulged in a real "hunt for the Aragonese" which quickly spread throughout the island, becoming a carnage. The few Aragonese who survived the massacre succeeded in taking refuge in their ships, moored along the coast. \nTo locate the French who disguised themselves as commoners, we resorted to a shibboleth, showing them chickpeas ("cíciri", in our language) and asking to pronounce their name; those who were betrayed by their Aragonese pronunciation (cigrons), were immediately killed.\n\nOur diplomats will take at least 60 days before being able to report back."

 ME_Sicily_Events.7.T: "Sicilian Renaissance"
 ME_Sicily_Events.7.D: "The gigantic figure in the cultural landscape of the early Renaissance in Sicily is Antonello da Messina who with his complex formation between Naples, Venice and Flanders demonstrates the circulation of ideas that characterized the era. His works for the commissions of the island and his definitive return home represented the first affirmation of Renaissance painting on the island, thanks to a crowded laboratory that introduced the new taste for the human figure, the pictorial genre of the portrait into traditional production. and a new role of the artist are no longer just an anonymous craftsman. \nAmong the most interesting artists active in Messina Giorgio da Milano, Andrea Mancino, Bernardino Nobile and the Carrarese Giovan Battista Mazzolo, owner of an important workshop, which was joined by Messina Antonio Freri (also active in Catania), without count the presence of Antonello Gagini, son of Domenico, in Messina. As in Palermo, these Tuscan and Lombard artists brought in the city and its surroundings to Calabria, the rich repertoire of classicist architectural decorations. However, throughout the fifteenth century, despite some obsolete interpretations, the architecture continued to follow the late Gothic tradition despite the presence of Renaissance decorative episodes. \nThe renewal of language therefore did not immediately involve the entire building organization. The main Sicilian architect of the fifteenth century was in fact Matteo Carnilivari who used a personal language with Gothic and Catalan elements, as in the church of Santa Maria della Catena in Palermo. His prestige as a builder was one of the obstacles to the affirmation of the Renaissance language, outside the decorative repertoire of marble workers. In addition to the few traces left by Laurana, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Renaissance language can be found only in minor episodes such as the Ventimiglia chapel in the church of San Francesco in Castelbuono."

 ME_Sicily_Events.8.T: "Civitas Invitissima"
 ME_Sicily_Events.8.D: "The city of Drepanum has a long story of being the shield of the Island against foreign armies, The important strategic position was used during the First Punic War when the Carthaginians defeated the Roman fleet in the Battle of Trapani in 249 BC. Thus the Romans conquered the city, latinizing its name in Drepanum. \n\nAfter the Romans, the Vandals, then the Byzantines dominated the city, but it was in the 9th century AD. with the Arabs (who called it Itràbinis, Taràbanis, Tràpanesch) and with the Normans (who conquered it in 1077 led by Roger I) that the city reached a fervent development, thriving in trade and cultural activities, so the port had great turmoil also thanks to the crusades. The port of Trapani, during the Middle Ages, was one of the most important in the Mediterranean: all the most powerful seaside cities (Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Amalfi) had a consulate in the Trapani port and, especially with the first two, Trapani had the agreement to act as a stopover for their possessions in North Africa. \n\nIn 1266 the Venetian and Genoese fleets collided in front of the port of Trapani during the San Saba war. The Venetians captured the entire Genoese fleet. \n\nAfter a short period under the Angevins, Trapani actively participated in the uprising of the Sicilian Vespers led by Palmiero Abate, passing to the Aragonese in 1282. During the 14th and 15th centuries the city grew and became the most economically and politically important center of western Sicily. In 1443, from simple Earth it became Civitas. Ferdinand the Catholic granted the city the title of Invittissima in this regard \"of the glorious resistance always made to the enemies of the kingdom\"."
