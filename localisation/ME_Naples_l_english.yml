In those same years the French master Jean Fouquet and Veronese Pisanello were in town. The main local artist of the first half of the century was Colantonio, in whose works the ability to absorb and assimilate the different languages ​​present in the city is manifested: if a work like San Girolamo in the studio (around 1444) shows references to Flemish painting in the realistic "still life" of books and other objects that fill the shelves, in the Delivery of the Franciscan Rule, a little later (around 1445), the various Catalan influences are already registered, as demonstrated by the vertical climbing floor, the expressive features and the rigid and geometric folds of the clothes."
