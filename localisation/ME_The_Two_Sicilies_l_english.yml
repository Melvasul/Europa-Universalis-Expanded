 tts_real_esercito_title: "Real Esercito"
 tts_real_esercito_desc: "\"The Neapolitan soldier is lively, intelligent, daring, and in a very imaginative one; and yet easy to exalt and run to the most daring enterprises, but easy to run away. He easily submits to discipline, when this moves from a just power, strong and constant. The elementary education of the different weapons is excellent: they maneuver exactly and promptly, both separate and united;\" \nAlthough the Royal Army was built only in 1734, the Neapolitan and Sicilian military institutions boast a much older history, which has its foundations in the organization of a "state-owned" (ie state and no longer feudal) army by Ferrante d Aragon in 1464. In particular, the Spanish viceregal period (1503-1714) profoundly marked the military customs of the subsequent Bourbon period. During this time the soldiers of southern Italy were in fact involved in almost all the military events of the Spanish Empire (from the wars of Charles V to the wars of Flanders, from the colonial campaigns in America to the thirty years war), often giving proof of great value and loyalty to the imperial authorities. The captains, belonging to the best feudal nobility of the Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces, were able to frame and prepare the subjects of the two viceroys for war, obeying the firm political direction given by the monarchs of Spain."

Carlo-the Partenope, and the four galleys S. Gennaro, Concezione, S. Antonio and Capitana , in addition to some minor wood. \nAt the same time the Marine Infantry Corps was established, the first in Italy designed to operate on board warships together with crews; later on his duties also included the supervision of naval bases. \nOur attempt to unite the Italian peninsula and creating a fleet to dominate the others seas should start with the creation of the largest navy the Mediterranean has ever seen."

 tts_royal_palace_title: "Reggia di Caserta"
 tts_royal_palace_desc: "\"The location is of exceptional beauty, in the most luxuriant plain in the world, but with extensive gardens that extend to the hills; an aqueduct leads you to an entire river, which waters the palace and its surroundings, and this water mass it can transform, pouring it on artificial rocks, into a wonderful waterfall. The gardens are beautiful and harmonize very much with this district which is a single garden.\" \nThe Royal Palace of Caserta was wanted by the King of Sicily [Root.Monarch.GetName], who, taken from a \"competition\" with the French royals and eager to donate structures to Naples that could play the role of the capital city of European level, he decided to inaugurate a palace that could rival in magnificence and grandeur with those of the European capitals. For safety reasons, the chosen location was Casertavecchia about 15 km north of the capital. \nThe king asked that the project include, in addition to the palace, the park and the arrangement of the surrounding urban area, with the supply from a new aqueduct (Acquedotto Carolino) that would cross the annexed complex of San Leucio. The new palace was to be a symbol of the new Bourbon state and to show power and grandeur, but also to be efficient and rational. \nThe project was part of the broader political plan of king [Root.Monarch.GetName], who probably also wanted to move some administrative structures of the state to the new Royal Palace, connecting it to the capital Naples with a monumental avenue of over 15 km."
 tts_maschio_angioino_title: "Maschio Angioino"
 tts_maschio_angioino_desc: "The presence of an external monarchy had set the urban planning of Naples around the center of royal power, constituting an alternative urban center, formed by the port and the two main adjacent castles, Castel Capuano and Castel dell'Ovo. This relationship between the royal court and town planning had already manifested itself with Frederick II, who in the 13th century, in the Swabian statute, had concentrated the greatest attention on castles, neglecting the city walls at all. To the two existing castles the Angevins added the main one, Castel Nuovo (Chastiau neuf), which was not only a fortification but above all their grandiose palace. \nThe royal residence of Naples had until then been Castel Capuano, but the ancient Norman fortress was judged inadequate for its function and the king wanted to build a new castle near the sea. \nAssigned the project to the French architect Pierre de Chaulnes, the works for the construction of the Castrum Novum began in 1279 and ended just three years later, a very short time given the construction techniques of the time and the overall size of the work. However, the king never resided there: following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers, which cost Angioino the crown of Sicily, conquered by Peter III of Aragon and other events, the new palace remained unused until 1285, the year of his death. by Carlo I. \nAlfonso of Aragon, who had conquered the throne of Naples in 1443, wanted to establish in the castle the function of the center of royal power and a court of magnificence that could compete with that of Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence. The fortress was completely rebuilt in its present form. King Alfonso entrusted the renovation of the old Angevin palace-fortress to an Aragonese architect, Guillem Sagrera, a Catalan from Mallorca, who conceived it in Gothic-Catalan terms. \nThe five round towers, four of which incorporated the previous Angevin towers with a square plan, more suitable for withstanding the shots of the guns of the time, reaffirmed the defensive role of the castle. The importance of the building as a center of royal power was instead underlined by the insertion of the triumphal arch at its entrance, a masterpiece of the Neapolitan Renaissance and the work of Francesco Laurana as well as many artists of various origins."
